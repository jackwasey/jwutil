\title{Tools for testing and data manipulation not found elsewhere}
\description{
This is a set of simple utilities for various data manipulation and testing tasks.
The goal is to use core R tools well, without bringing in many
dependencies. Main areas of interest are semi-automated data frame manipulation, such as
converting factors in multiple binary indicator columns. There are testing
functions which provide 'testthat' expectations to permute arguments to
function calls. There are functions and data to test extreme numbers, dates,
and bad input of various kinds which should allow testing failure and corner
cases, which can be used for fuzzing your functions. The test suite has many examples of usage.

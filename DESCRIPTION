Description: This is a set of simple utilities for various data manipulation and
    caching tasks. The goal is to use base tools well, without bringing in any
    dependencies. Main areas of interest are data frame manipulation, such as
    converting factors in multiple binary indicator columns, and disk caching of
    data frames (which is optionally done by date range). There are testing
    functions which provide testthat expectations to permute arguments to
    function calls. There are functions and data to test extreme numbers, dates,
    and bad input of various kinds which should allow testing failure and corner
    cases. The test suite has many examples of usage.

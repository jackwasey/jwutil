Description: This is a set of simple utilities for various data manipulation tasks.
    The goal is to use base tools well, without bringing in many
    dependencies. Main areas of interest are semi-automated data frame manipulation, such as
    converting factors in multiple binary indicator columns. There are testing
    functions which provide testthat expectations to permute arguments to
    function calls. There are functions and data to test extreme numbers, dates,
    and bad input of various kinds which should allow testing failure and corner
    cases, which can be used for fuzzing your functions. The test suite has many examples of usage.
